The PRIDE Experiment Design project will handle and represent each PRIDE project with the corresponding experiment design, including the annotation of:

* Biological sample Metadata.
* The relationship between the Sample and the MSRun
* The Fraction and Fraction Group
* MSRun Metadata.

The following design is based on other efforts from link:../proteomics-propietary-examples/external-examples/openms-experimental/OpenMS.md[OpenMS], link:../proteomics-propietary-examples/external-examples/maxquant/mqpar-jarnuczak-phospho.xml[MaxQuant], link:../proteomics-propietary-examples/external-examples/arrayexpress/ArrayExpress.md[ArrayExpress]

[[ontologies-supported]]
== Ontologies Supported

The list of ontologies supported by this project can be found https://github.com/PRIDE-Archive/pride-metadata-standard#3-ontologies[here].

[[sample-metadata]]
== Minimum information about Sample

The *Sample* metadata capture the steps in the chain of treatments applied to the original Source. The sample metadata structure is based on the MAGE-TAB SDRF file format developed by the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/help/magetab_spec.html[RNA-Seq community].

NOTE: The collaboration with the RNA-Seq community and the compatibility with the SDRF file format will enable the development of tools and bioinformatics workflows that can analyze all type of expression data (proteomics, transcriptomics).

The Sample metadata has different *Categories/Headings*  to organize all the attributes / column headers of the Sample:

|===
|Property        | Mandatory/Optional | Cardinality | Description | Example

|Source  Name    | Optional           | 1           | The Sample name. | Source Name
|Characteristics | Mandatory          | 0..*        | “Characteristics” column headings should contain an ontology property term in square brackets. The source database or file for ontology terms in these columns may be given in an adjacent “Term Source” column immediately to the right of the “Characteristics” column. In the absence of a “Term Source” column the value is assumed to be user defined. Multiple Characteristic columns of the same category (e.g., “Characteristics[Organism Part]”) are allowed. Typically the usage implies whole to part from left to right. | Characteristics [Organism Part]
|Factor Value    | Optional           | 0..*        | “Factor Value” columns should indicate which experimental factor / variable are use to perform the quantitative data analysis. The “Factor Value” columns should occur after all Characteristics and the attributes of the samples. | Factor Value [phenotype]
|===

Each Sample in the experiment MUST contains a _Source Name_, and a collection of _Characteristics_. A minimum example of a valid annotated dataset can be:

|===
| Source Name | Characteristics [Organism] | Characteristics [Organism Part] | Characteristics [phenotype] | Characteristics [phenotype] | Factor Value [phenotype]

|sample_treat   |Homo Sapiens |Whole Organism | necrotic tissue      | sample treated with drug A | necrotic tissue
|sample_control |Homo Sapiens |Whole Organism | control              | control                    |     control
|===

Some important notes:

 - Each characteristics name in the column header SHOULD be a control vocabulary term from the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo[EFO ontology]. For example, the Header `Characteristics [Organism]` correspond to the ontology term http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000634[Organism].

 - Multiple values for the same Characteristics are allowed. In the previous example, the `Characteristics [phenotype]` attribute is used to capture two different phenotypes conditions of the sample.

NOTE: Each value in the row can be free-text or a control vocabulary term. In the previous example, the `Characteristics [phenotype]` value CAN BE the free-text _control_ or the corresponding ontology identifier in https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo[EFO] _http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0001461_

[[sample-templates]]
=== Sample metadata templates

The *sample metadata templates* are a set of guidelines to annotate different type of proteomics experiments to ensure that a Minimum Metadata and `Characteristics` are provided to understand the dataset. These templates respond to the distribution and frequency of expeirment types in public databases like http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive[PRIDE] and http://www.proteomexchange.org/[ProteomeXchange]:

- Human: All tissue-based experiments that use Human samples.
- Vertebrates: Vertebrate experiment.
- Non-vertebrates: Non-vertebrate experiment.
- Plants: Plant experiment.
- Cell lines: Experiments using cell-lines.

*Sample attributes*: Minimum sample attributes for primary cells from different species and cell lines

[[from-sample-scan]]
== From Sample to MsRun

The connection from the _Sample_ to the final _MSrun_ would be done by a series of properties and attributes. We RECOMMENDED the following properties to be present on each Sample Row:

MSRun: From each MSRun we need to capture:

 - Label: The _label_ describe the labeling process applied to each Sample. In case of Multiplex Experiments such as TMT, SILAC, ITRAQ the corresponding Label should be added. For Label-free experiments the https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ms/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMS_1002038[label free sample]

 - Comment [Fraction Identifier]: The _fraction identifier_ allows to know the number of your fraction. The fraction identifier correspond to this https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ms/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMS_1000858[ontology term].

 - Comment [Raw Data File]: The _raw data file_ provides the name of the raw file from the instrument. The raw data file correspond to this https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ms/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMS_1000577[ontology term].

TIP: All the possible _Label_ values can be seen in the in the PSI-MS ontology under https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ms/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMS_1002602[sample label] node.

The “Comment” columns in *SDRF* are included as a basic extensibility mechanism for local implementations. The name associated with the comment is included in square
brackets in the column heading, and the value(s) entered in the body of the column. Comment columns could be used in various ways - to provide references to external files like
raw files or protocols; to include identifiers of objects in external systems; to qualify the type of Protocol REF (e.g., growth protocol).

[[sample-scan-additional]]
=== MSRun additional properties

Some search engines as MaxQuant use the Fraction Group to perform better statistical analysis:

- Comment [Fraction Group]: Some Quantitative tools use the Fraction Group to know which fractions belong together.
