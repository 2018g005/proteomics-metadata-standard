Experimental Design:
====================

The PRIDE Experimental Design project will handle and represent each PRIDE project with the corresponding experiment design, including the annotation of:

- Sample Metadata.
- MSRun Metadata.
- The relation beetween the Sample and the MSRun
- The Fraction and Fraction Group

The following design is based on other efforts from [OpenMS](openms-experimental/OpenMS.md), [MaxQuant](maxquant/mqpar-jarnuczak-phospho.xml), [ArrayExpress](arrayexpress/ArrayExpress.md)
