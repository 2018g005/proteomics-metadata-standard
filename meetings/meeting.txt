Technical discussion about ELIXIR Metadata project
==================================================
Project 1 -  First pipeline for re-calibration of RAW files (Lead by Magnus)
  - API in PRIDE side to store information for recalibration/QC of MSRun (Yasset Pride Team)
  - Select projects in PRIDE that can be annotated with the calibration (Magnus)
    - CPTAC. (One interested)
  - Detect other instruments and analyzed multiple instruments

Project 2 -  QC and standarization: Create a standard file format in (JSON) to represent
recalibration / QC for each MSRun (Lead By Eduard Sabido)
  - This file Json should be similar to mzML data structure and enabling the query of MSRun
  - At least three QC metrics should be included by each MSRun.

Project 3 -  Asap in PRIDE (Lead By Yasset Perez-Riverol)
  - SearchGUI param standard file format.
  - More documentation should be provided about how to translate from searchGUI params to actual
  search engine parameters (Harald Barnes)

Project 4 - Partial Submissions using parameters prediction with Lennart tool. (Lead Lennart)
    * AbSicex -> Eduard Sabido
    * Bruker -> Magnus
    * Thermo -> Yasset Perez-Riverol, Lennart
* Long-term project predict PTMs for Partial submissions.

Project 5 - Explore Experimental Design File formats that should be used for annotating Projects
in a desktop application. (Mathias and Lead)
  - Evaluate ISATab to represent PRIDE projects.
  - Annotate 10 projects.
  - Define the metadata (EFO, PSI-MS, PSI-MOD, UNIMOD)
  - PRIDE will accept this files as additional files into Submission.
